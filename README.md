# Doorcode

Doorcode is a graphQL based service which provides one-time-only / passwordless tokens that can be used as a method for giving access to restricted systems, applications or user accounts.

Not only does doorcode provide a means to authenticate users without requiring a password based system, but it also acts as a single source of truth for user verification and provides a UUID generator. UUIDs are claimed by users when they verify themselves against the service.
